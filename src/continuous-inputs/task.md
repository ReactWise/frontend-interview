# Frontend Interview Task

Create a form that manages a "Continuous Input" configuration.

## Requirements

### 1. Create Form

Build a form for creating a Continuous Input with the following fields:

- name
- unit
- decimals
- min
- max
- is_discrete (continuous or discrete)
  - if discrete, also ask for step size

### 2. Submit

When the form is submitted, call a dummy submit function that console logs the data.

### 3. Pre-Fill

Load existing data and pre-fill the form.

### 4. Live Updates

Remove the submit button and switch to live updates. Changes to any input field should automatically trigger a "patch" mutation (a dummy function that console logs the data)

### 5. Code Review (Last 5 Minutes)

- usability
- accessibility
- clarity
- maintainability
- performance considerations?
